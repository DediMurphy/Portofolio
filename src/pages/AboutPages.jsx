            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-justify font-sans">
              I am an undergraduate student majoring in Information Technology who has an interest in mobile application development. Since the beginning of my studies, I have been interested in the world of technology, especially in
              software development. Nowadays, I am increasingly interested in focusing on mobile app development because I believe that the mobility and connectivity offered by mobile devices can open up huge opportunities in improving user
              experience and solving various problems in everyday life.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-justify"> In my educational journey, I have learned the basic concepts of programming, data structures, and algorithms. Additionally, I have also gained a solid understanding of
              mobile application platform development, such as Android. I have attended various courses, training and small projects to improve my skills in software development.</p>
